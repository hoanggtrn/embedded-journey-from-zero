# 🚀 Embedded Learning Journey

A personal roadmap to become an Embedded / Firmware Engineer from scratch — rebuilding my foundation in C, C++, Python, and Electronics, and documenting every step through projects and notes.

🧩 Overview

This repository tracks my self-study journey after graduation, where I rebuild my coding skills and strengthen my embedded systems knowledge.

🎯 Goal: Become a Hardware / Embedded Engineer capable of designing circuits and writing firmware.

🕒 Duration: 12–18 months

🧠 Study mode: Self-learning + practice-based + documented progress

🔁 Updated weekly with new commits, notes, and projects.
